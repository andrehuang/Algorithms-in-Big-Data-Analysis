# Algorithms-in-Big-Data-Analysis

This repository contains the code for the course Algorithms in Big Data Analysis by Zaiwen Wen at Peking University.

see http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/bigdata2018.html

**project1 report.pdf** can help you navigate the problems and algorithms of the code in l1_minimization and Sparse-Inverse.

**phase-hw.pdf** can help you navigate the problems and algorithms of the code in Phase-Retrieval.

**hw-sto-report.pdf** can help you navigate the problems and algorithms of the code in Stochastic-Optimization.

**svd-report.pdf** can help you navigate the problems and algorithms of the code in SVD.
